    Example usage of the Scraper class to perform a flight search on Google Flights.

    Steps:
    1. Initialize the Scraper object to interact with Google Flights.
    2. Define the parameters for the flight search:
       - origin: The departure location (can be an IATA code or city name).
       - destination: The arrival location (can be an IATA code or city name).
       - duration: The duration of the trip in days.
       - passengers: The number of passengers for the flight.
       - search_dates: A tuple containing the start and end dates for the search (format: 'YYYY-MM-DD').
       - limit: The maximum number of flight results to return.
    3. Call the `search()` method with the specified parameters to perform the search.
    4. Print the resulting flight options returned by the search.

    Example:
    - Searching for flights from "MCZ" (Macei√≥) to "Santiago" with a 7-day duration, 2 passengers, 
      and a date range from '2025-08-01' to '2025-09-30', limiting the results to 1 flight.
